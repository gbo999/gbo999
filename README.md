# 👋 Hi, I'm Gil — Aspiring Data Scientist with a Deep Tech Foundation

I'm an aspiring data scientist. My Master's thesis involved building real-world systems for object detection and measurement in aquaculture — now, I'm shifting my focus toward applying data science to broader challenges across industries.

## 🎓 Master’s Thesis (2025) — AI for Aquaculture

### 🦐 [Computer Vision for Aquaculture Monitoring](https://github.com/gbo999/Computer-Vision-for-Aquaculture-Monitoring-Robot)

> A full deep learning pipeline for automated prawn counting and length measurement in underwater ponds — part of my 2025 master’s thesis.

✅ Highlights:
- YOLOv8-based detection model for counting prawns in drone footage  
- Pose estimation for precise morphometric measurements  
- Ground truth validation using ImageJ and prawn exuviae  
- Dataset management, error analysis, and interactive exploration via FiftyOne  


This project taught me how to:
- Handle noisy, real-world data
- train deep learning models
- Work with metrics, visualization, and automation tools
- Document and communicate research clearly

## 🎯 My Path Into Data Science

Now, I'm expanding into **core data science skills**, including:
- Data cleaning & exploration (Pandas, SQL)
- Machine learning & evaluation (scikit-learn)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Business-oriented thinking and storytelling with data
